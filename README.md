### This is my project for practicing html, css and JS.

The project is educational, the layout used is from the figma community.

There are such elements as:
1. Implementation of burger-menu for adaptability
2. Application of the swiper component and its personalization
3. The tabulation functionality was used, with a change in the content part
4. Animation and CSS properties have been studied in depth


And this project shows skills in using Git and GH.
